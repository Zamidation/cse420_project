# cse420_project
This is the project github to organize the files we need to create the final project for CSE 420 W20. This is a collaboration with Montana Williams and Mike Cheng-Godinez.


FIRST THING TO DO WHEN WORKING ON PROJECT

1) git pull   // check to see if up to date, otherwise we will be now!
2) make edits

WHEN YOU WANT TO UPLOAD WORK TO REPOSITORY

3) git add -A // pushes everthing into queue
4) git commit -m "MESSAGE" // basically this establishes that you are certain of the changes and write a message
5) git push   // this pushes your changes into the repository

If we establish good communication, we won't have many issues!
